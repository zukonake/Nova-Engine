# Nova-Engine
A very customizable rogue-like game engine with gameplay defined by Lua.

# Development
Extremely early WIP. Haven't even built it yet. Stay tuned.
If anyone is willing to contribute then go on,
it would be faster to work in a group.
Also thanks for any critic opinions,
as I am still learning how to write cleaner code.
